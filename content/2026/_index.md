# About

Driven by the New Space movement, the complexity and frequency of
space missions is increasing swiftly, creating a pressing need for automation in
both early-stage mission design and onboard decision-making. This
workshop explores how automated reasoning can address key challenges
in future space
logistics such as routing, scheduling, planning, and reliability
analysis, while also tackling verification and validation aspects of
AI systems integrated into spacecraft autonomy (e.g., GNC and
AOCS). By bringing together researchers from formal methods and space
systems, the event aims to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration and
advance trustworthy, certifiable AI for safety-critical space
applications.

# Call for Contributions

Workshop contributions can be extended abstracts as well as short and
long papers (including already published results). There are no
formatting guidelines for contributions. Accepted contributions will
be invited for presentation at the workshop. 

Paper submissions are handled through this [FLoC submission system.](https://submissions.floc26.org/ar4space)

The submission deadline is **May 11, 2026 AoE**.

# Scope of the Workshop

The event focuses on the methodological and technical challenges of
enabling reliable, scalable, and autonomous logistics operations in
space. Topics include on-board reasoning and autonomous
decision-making for distributed space assets, formal verification and
validation of AI-based logistics systems, automated mission and supply
planning, and large-scale optimization problems such as multi-vehicle
coordination, in-orbit servicing, refueling, and cargo routing. 

Both foundational contributions (covering computational complexity,
algorithm design, modeling approaches, and problem encodings) and
application-driven case studies addressing realistic logistics
scenarios (e.g., cislunar infrastructure, orbital depots, planetary
supply chains) are equally welcome. 

# Registration

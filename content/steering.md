# Steering Committee 

The AR4Space Steering Committee defines the scientific direction and
overall structure of the event series. It is responsible for selecting
the thematic focus and format of events, as well as determining the
venue, duration, and frequency of workshops and seminars. The
Committee also appoints the organizers for individual events within
the series. 

If you are interested in organizing an event, contributing to the
series, or would like further information about AR4Space, we warmly
encourage you to contact any member of the Steering Committee. 

The Steering Committee currently consists of the following members:

- [Max Bannach](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/team/max_bannach/) (European Space Agency)
- [Dario Izzo](https://www.esa.int/gsp/ACT/team/dario_izzo/) (European Space Agency)

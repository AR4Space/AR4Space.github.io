# Data Processed by Third-Party Event Hosts

AR4Space seminars and workshops are organized in cooperation with
established academic venues and institutions (referred to as "Hosts"). 
Participation in an event typically requires separate registration through the Host’s platform.

**Important:**

- The Committee does not transfer personal data you provided to the Committee to the Host unless explicitly agreed or necessary.
- Any data you provide directly to the Host (e.g., via registration portals, booking forms, or accommodation systems) is processed under the Host’s own privacy policy.
- The Committee is not responsible for data collected, stored, or processed independently by the Host.

We encourage participants to review the privacy policy of the respective Host before submitting personal data.

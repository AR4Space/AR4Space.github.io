# About

**Automated Reasoning for Space (AR4Space)** is a seminar and workshop
series that brings together researchers in automated reasoning in the
broader sense (including formal methods, constraint satisfaction,
logic-based optimization, probabilistic and non-monotonic reasoning,
neuro-symbolic reasoning, knowledge representation and compilation,
automated planning, argumentation, and related areas) with engineers
and practitioners from industry, academia, and space agencies working
on the design and operation of future space missions.

As space missions rapidly grow in scale, autonomy, and complexity,
there is an increasing need for rigorous, reliable, and intelligent
decision-making tools. The primary goal of AR4Space is to bridge the
automated reasoning and space engineering communities by fostering a
shared vocabulary, exchanging challenges and lessons learned, and
adapting state-of-the-art reasoning methods to the dynamic and
safety-critical problems arising in future space missions.

The frequency, duration, and format of seminars and workshops within
the series are determined by the [steering committee](steering), depending on the
topic and community interest. In the list below, you will find an
overview of past and upcoming AR4Space events. While most events
are invitation-based to facilitate focused discussion, we
encourage you to contact the [steering committee](steering) if you would like to
participate in a future event or become involved in organizing an
edition of the series.

# Scope of the AR4Space Series

The scope of AR4Space is intentionally broad, reflecting both the
methodological diversity of automated reasoning and the technical
breadth of modern space missions. Topics range from on-board reasoning
and autonomous decision-making, formal verification and validation of
AI-based systems for space applications, and automated mission
planning, to large-scale optimization challenges such as multi-flyby
and multi-rendezvous trajectory design. Both theoretical and
foundational contributions (such as computational
complexity, algorithm design, modeling techniques, and problem
encodings) and application-driven case studies addressing concrete
mission scenarios are equally welcome.
